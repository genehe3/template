# template
A template file containg: An HTML file (contains the "what" of the website. Not much use on its own) with basic boilerplate code, 
A blank css (styling for the page, such as font-size or background-color for different HTML elements) file linked to main HTML file, 
and a blank javascript file (used for functionality of website, such as added buttons) linked to main HTML file.

I decided to create a template as all of my projects started with these 3 files.
Every second saved is more time for developing the code.
